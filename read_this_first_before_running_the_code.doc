DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARD (DES) 
AIM: To apply Data Encryption Standard (DES) Algorithm for a practical application like User Message Encryption in PYTHON or JAVA.
Data Encryption Standard (DES) Algorithm Implementation:
Create a DES Key:
You need to generate a DES key. The key should be securely generated and managed.
Create a Cipher Instance:
Use the Cipher class to create an instance. Specify the algorithm name (DES), mode (optional, e.g., ECB or CBC), and padding scheme (optional, e.g., PKCS5Padding).
Convert String to Byte[] Array:
Convert the message (plaintext) from a string format to a byte array format. This conversion is necessary for encryption.
Encryption:
Initialize the Cipher in encryption mode and encrypt the plaintext using the Cipher.doFinal() method. This method will return the encrypted ciphertext.
Decryption:
Initialize the Cipher in decryption mode and decrypt the ciphertext using the Cipher.doFinal() method. This will return the original plaintext.

This code will not run accordingly if pycryptodome is not installed
Before you run this code, make sure that you install first the pycryptodome.

How to install pycryptodome:
1. Open your terminal.
2. Type "pip install pycryptodome" in powershell, then click enter.
3. Once the pycryptodome is installed, you are ready to run the code.
